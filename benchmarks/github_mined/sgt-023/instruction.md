## Description

Stack from [ghstack](https://github.com/ezyang/ghstack/tree/0.12.0) (oldest at bottom):
* __->__ #152361

Context: see #155795

To understand the effect of this libgomp version update, I benchmarked all the following combinations on Arm Neoverse-V1 CPUs:
- models: distilbert, bert-base, bert-large
- modes: eager, compile
- context_length: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512
- dtype: float32, bfloat16 (autocast), int8 (dynamically quantized)
- threads: 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, 64
- pytorch builds: without #1
