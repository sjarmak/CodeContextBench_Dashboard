# Write Unit Test for search_file Function

**Repository:** OpenHands (TheAgentCompany GitLab)  
**Difficulty:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** tac_mcp_value  
**Task Type:** Test Writing

## Description

Navigate to the OpenHands repository, find and understand the search_file function,
then write a comprehensive unit test for it. This tests code understanding and
test authoring skills.

**Why this benefits from MCP:**
- Finding the function implementation in a large codebase
- Understanding function behavior from implementation
- Finding existing test patterns in the codebase as examples
- Understanding usage patterns of the function

## Task

Navigate to the OpenHands GitLab at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands

1. Clone the git repository to the /workspace directory and set up Poetry package management
2. Find function `search_file` in the file 
   `/workspace/openhands/openhands/runtime/plugins/agent_skills/file_ops/file_ops.py`
3. Write a unit test named `test_search_file` in the file 
   `/workspace/openhands/tests/unit/test_agent_skill.py` for the `search_file` function

## Success Criteria

✅ Repository cloned and Poetry set up  
✅ test_search_file function exists  
✅ Test is comprehensive and covers function behavior  
✅ Test passes when run

## Notes

- This task tests understanding of function behavior for test design
- MCP helps find existing test patterns and understand the function
- Deterministic grading via test execution
