# Find Answer in Codebase - File Change PR

**Repository:** llama.cpp (TheAgentCompany GitLab)  
**Difficulty:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** tac_mcp_value  
**Task Type:** Code Navigation & Search

## Description

Find the latest pull request that changes a specific file in the llama.cpp codebase.
This tests git history navigation and file change tracking.

**Why this benefits from MCP:**
- Searching for file changes in commit/PR history
- Understanding the context of changes
- Navigating git history efficiently

## Task

Your colleague Chen Xinyi wants to know the latest pull request (starting with #) that 
changes the file `ggml/src/ggml-sycl/dequantize.hpp` in the `llama.cpp` codebase from 
GitLab (http://the-agent-company.com:8929). 

After you find it you need to send the PR number to Chen Xinyi on RocketChat 
(http://the-agent-company.com:3000).

## Success Criteria

✅ Correct PR number found for file change  
✅ PR number communicated to Chen Xinyi via RocketChat

## Notes

- This is another code search task
- Validates MCP advantage on git history search
- Requires RocketChat interaction to complete
