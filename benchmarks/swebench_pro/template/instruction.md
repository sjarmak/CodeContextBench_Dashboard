{problem_statement}

---

**Repo:** `{repo}`  
**Base commit:** `{base_commit}`  
**Instance ID:** `{instance_id}`

## Guidelines

1. Analyze the issue description carefully
2. Explore the codebase to understand the architecture  
3. Implement a fix that resolves the issue
4. Ensure existing tests pass and the fix addresses the problem

## MCP Tools Available

If Sourcegraph MCP is configured, you can use:
- **Deep Search** for understanding complex code relationships
- **Keyword Search** for finding specific patterns
- **File Reading** for exploring the codebase

This is a long-horizon software engineering task that may require understanding multiple components across a large codebase.
