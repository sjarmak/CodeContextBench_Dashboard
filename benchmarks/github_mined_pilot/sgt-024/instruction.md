## Description

When trying to bring cu129 back in https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/163029, I mainly looked at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/163029 and missed another tweak coming from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/162455

I discover this issue when testing aarch64+cu129 builds in https://github.com/pytorch/test-infra/actions/runs/18603342105/job/53046883322?pr=7373.  Surprisingly, there is no test running for aarch64 CUDA build from what I see in https://hud.pytorch.org/pytorch/pyt
