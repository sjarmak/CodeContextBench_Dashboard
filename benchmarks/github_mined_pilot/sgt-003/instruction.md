## Description

Fixes #169388

This PR adds a cleanup for graphs from failed dynamo tracer outputs. These graphs hold onto reference cycles:
1. The nodes of the graph form a doubly linked list and point back to the graph, which creates a cycle
2. FakeTensorMode → ShapeEnv → TrackedFake → FakeTensor → FakeTensorMode creates a cycle

To avoid needing to do a full garbage collection, this change instead manually cleans up these reference cycles to allow for immediate garbage collection. Manually cleaning up
