description: |
  Generate comprehensive package documentation (doc.go) for the kubelet
  container manager (cm) package. This package is responsible for managing
  containers on Kubernetes nodes, including cgroup configuration, QoS
  enforcement, and resource allocation.

  Evaluation is performed by comparing the generated doc.go against the
  original ground truth using an LLM judge.

task_prompt: |
  You are documenting the `pkg/kubelet/cm` package in Kubernetes. The existing
  documentation has been removed, and you need to recreate it based on the
  source code.

  Your task is to create a `doc.go` file in `pkg/kubelet/cm/` that:
  1. Explains what the container manager package does
  2. Lists key responsibilities and capabilities
  3. Describes major types and interfaces
  4. Notes any platform-specific behavior (Linux, Windows)
  5. References related packages if appropriate

  The documentation should follow Go documentation conventions and be suitable
  for inclusion in the official Kubernetes codebase.

expected_output:
  type: file
  filename: doc.go
  location: pkg/kubelet/cm/doc.go

ground_truth:
  primary_file: ground_truth/doc.go

verifier:
  type: script
  script: test.sh

  With Sourcegraph tools searching the kubernetes-stripped index, an agent can:
  - Search for related packages and their architectural patterns
  - Find KEPs and design discussions (if not stripped from index)
  - Discover how this package is used by other parts of the kubelet
  - Understand the broader context of resource management in Kubernetes
