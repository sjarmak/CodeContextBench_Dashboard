description: |
  Create comprehensive documentation for the Kubelet Topology Manager that
  coordinates NUMA-aware resource allocation across CPU, memory, and device managers.

  Evaluation is performed by comparing the generated README.md against the
  original ground truth (KEP-693) using an LLM judge.

task_prompt: |
  You are documenting the `pkg/kubelet/cm/topologymanager` package in Kubernetes.
  The existing documentation has been removed, and you need to recreate it based
  on the source code.

  Your task is to create a comprehensive `README.md` in `pkg/kubelet/cm/topologymanager/` that:
  1. Provides an overview of Topology Manager purpose
  2. Explains NUMA topology concepts
  3. Documents all policy types (none, best-effort, restricted, single-numa-node)
  4. Describes hint provider interface
  5. Explains integration with CPU/Memory/Device managers

  The documentation should follow standard Markdown format and be suitable
  for inclusion in the official Kubernetes documentation.

expected_output:
  type: file
  filename: README.md
  location: pkg/kubelet/cm/topologymanager/README.md

ground_truth:
  primary_file: ground_truth/kep-693.md

verifier:
  type: script
  script: test.sh

  Topology Manager is highly technical with complex dependencies on NUMA
  concepts and other resource managers. With Sourcegraph Deep Search
  searching the kubernetes-stripped index, an agent can:
  - Find KEP-693 with design rationale
  - Discover related KEPs for CPU/Memory managers
  - Understand node resource allocation patterns
  - Grasp hardware topology concepts used in the implementation
