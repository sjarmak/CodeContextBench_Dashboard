  "ground_truth": "Based on a hypothetical analysis of the codebase:\n\n1.  **Component Identification:**\n    -   **Batch Pipeline:** The core components are `module_10` (Timer-triggered Orchestrator), `module_34` (Data Fetcher for large files from an FTP/Blob source), and `module_65` (Heavy, multi-stage data transformation and aggregation).\n    -   **Stream Pipeline:** The core components are `module_7` (Event Hub/Queue Trigger), `module_26` (Data Enrichment/Validation), and `module_80` (Real-time Sink/Writer).\n\n2.  **Bottleneck Analysis:**\n    -   The batch orchestrator, `module_10`, is configured with a timer schedule (`Cron` expression in the config) that cannot be set to less than one minute and is designed for singleton execution to prevent overlapping runs.\n    -   The data fetcher, `module_34`, is optimized for large files. It lists all files in a directory and downloads them, an operation that is inefficient and slow for small, frequent data drops.\n    -   The primary bottleneck is `module_65`. Its constructor or an early-stage method loads several large lookup tables and a pre-trained ML model from storage into memory. This initialization takes 20-30 seconds, which is unacceptable for a 90-second total SLA on a 30-second interval. The architecture assumes a long-running job where this startup cost is amortized over a large dataset.\n\n3.  **Proposed Architectural Solution:**\n    -   Create a new **Micro-Batch Orchestrator**, `module_90` (a new file). This module will be triggered by a message on a dedicated queue, which an upstream data source will populate every 30-60 seconds.\n    -   Reuse the stream processing trigger pattern from `module_7` for the new orchestrator.\n    -   The new orchestrator will call the existing transformation logic in `module_65`. However, `module_65` must be refactored. The expensive initialization logic (loading lookup tables/models) should be moved into a static constructor or a singleton service that is injected via dependency injection. This ensures the resources are loaded only once per function instance, and subsequent calls on a 'warm' instance are fast.\n    -   The data fetching logic from `module_34` cannot be reused directly. The new orchestrator will receive the data payload directly from the trigger's message, bypassing the need for a separate file-fetching step. The core data parsing logic within `module_34` can be extracted into a shared helper class and called by both the old batch pipeline and the new micro-batch orchestrator.\n    -   This approach creates a new, parallel path for micro-batches that reuses the most complex business logic (`module_65`) while creating a new, lightweight orchestration and data ingress mechanism better suited for low-latency requirements.",
