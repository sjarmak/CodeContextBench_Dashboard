## Task Title

Architectural Analysis for Real-Time Collaboration Feature

## Description

PaletteFlow Studio is a successful single-user desktop application for creative and technical professionals. The core value proposition is its infinite canvas where users can place different types of content 'nodes' (text, code, images, etc.) and link them together. The product team has identified real-time multi-user collaboration as the next major strategic feature. The current architecture, based on Electron, was designed exclusively for a single user interacting with a local file system. This task requires the AI agent to act as a software architect, analyzing the existing system to determine the feasibility of this new feature and outline the necessary architectural changes.

## Your Task

You are a principal engineer tasked with creating a technical design document for adding real-time collaboration to PaletteFlow Studio. Before writing the full design, you must first perform a thorough analysis of the current architecture. Your analysis should be presented as a markdown report answering the following key questions. Your answers must be justified by referencing specific files, design patterns, and architectural components in the existing codebase.

### Architectural Analysis Report

1.  **State Management & Source of Truth:**
    -   Where is the primary source of truth for a user's workspace data (nodes, links, content) currently stored?
    -   Describe the current state management strategy in both the main and renderer processes. How do they synchronize?
    -   Explain why this model is or is not suitable for a multi-user real-time environment.

2.  **Data Flow for Mutations:**
    -   Trace the complete data flow when a user performs a simple action, such as moving a node on the canvas in the renderer process, to the point where that change is persisted.
    -   Identify the key components (classes, services, functions) involved in this flow, including the IPC communication layer.
    -   Analyze the limitations of this data flow model in a scenario with multiple concurrent users.

3.  **Impact on the Plugin System:**
    -   The plugin API allows third-party code to read and modify workspace data (e.g., via the Node API described in `docs/plugin-api/reference/node-api.md`).
    -   How would the introduction of real-time collaboration affect the stability and predictability of the plugin ecosystem?
    -   What specific changes or additions to the plugin API (`IPluginService.ts`, API docs) would be necessary to support a collaborative environment safely?

4.  **Conflict Resolution Strategy:**
    -   Examine the core domain entities (e.g., `Workspace.ts`, `Node.ts`). Do they contain any properties that would support conflict resolution (e.g., version numbers, vector clocks, last-updated timestamps)?
    -   Based on the application's layered architecture (`core`, `adapters`, `main`, `renderer`), where would you recommend implementing the conflict resolution logic (e.g., CRDTs, OT)? Justify your choice.

## Expected Approach

An expert developer would approach this analysis systematically:

1.  **High-Level Orientation:** Start by reading `docs/architecture.md` to get a conceptual overview of the system's structure, including the main/renderer process split and the clean architecture principles being used (`core`, `adapters`).

2.  **Identify State Persistence:** Investigate how data is saved. This would lead them to `IWorkspaceRepository.ts` (the interface) and its implementation `FileSystemWorkspaceRepository.ts`. This immediately reveals the local, file-centric nature of the persistence layer.

3.  **Trace a User Action:** To understand data flow, they would pick a user action, like moving a node.
    -   Start in the UI: `renderer/components/canvas/NodeComponent.tsx` and `Draggable.tsx`.
    -   Follow the state update: This would likely involve a hook (`useViewModel.ts`) that calls a function to update the node's position.
    -   Trace to IPC: The update function would use the IPC bridge (`renderer/ipc/bridge.ts`) to send a message to the main process, likely using a channel defined in `src/main/ipc/channels.ts`.
    -   Trace in Main Process: They would find the corresponding handler in `main/ipc/handlers/workspaceHandlers.ts` or a similar file, which is registered by `IpcMainManager.ts`.
    -   Trace to Core Logic: The IPC handler would invoke a use case, such as `UpdateNodePosition.ts` from `src/core/application/use-cases/`.
    -   Trace to Persistence: The use case would then use the `IWorkspaceRepository` to call the `FileSystemWorkspaceRepository` and write the change to disk.

4.  **Analyze Plugin System:** Review the plugin API documentation (`docs/plugin-api/`) and the core service interface (`IPluginService.ts`). They would note that the APIs likely provide direct, synchronous-style access to data, which is problematic in a distributed system.

5.  **Examine Domain Models:** Open the core entity files like `Node.ts` and `Workspace.ts` to inspect their properties, looking for any metadata related to versioning or synchronization. The absence of such fields is a critical finding.

6.  **Synthesize Findings:** Finally, the developer would combine all these observations to answer the four questions, demonstrating a holistic understanding of how the components interact and why the current design presents significant challenges for real-time collaboration.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctly Identifies Architecture:** Accurately describes the Electron main/renderer architecture and the clean architecture layering (`core`, `adapters`).
- **Accurately Traces Data Flow:** Correctly traces the full path of a data mutation from the renderer UI, through the IPC bridge, to the main process handler, and finally to the file system repository.
- **Identifies State Management Flaws:** Correctly identifies the file system as the source of truth and explains why this single-user model is fundamentally incompatible with real-time collaboration.
- **Analyzes IPC Limitations:** Correctly identifies the IPC mechanism as a request-response pattern and explains its inadequacy for broadcasting state to multiple clients.
- **Assesses Plugin API Risks:** Demonstrates understanding of the plugin system's architecture and correctly identifies the risks of synchronous data access in a distributed context.
- **Proposes Correct Locus for Business Logic:** Correctly identifies the `core/application/use-cases` layer as the appropriate location for new conflict resolution logic, justifying the choice based on architectural principles.
- **Synthesizes Information:** The overall quality of the analysis, connecting findings from different files (docs, code, domain models) into a coherent and accurate architectural assessment.
