## Task Title

Intermittent Consensus Failure on Governance Proposal Transactions

## Description

The HoloCanvas network is experiencing intermittent consensus failures among validator nodes. The issue appears to be isolated to when the 'Delegated Authority' (DA) consensus strategy is active. Nodes running the default 'Proof-of-Stake' (PoS) strategy do not report these errors and continue to operate, leading to a potential chain fork. The failures correlate with the submission of large, complex governance proposals, specifically those that aim to update a generative art 'recipe' via the `TX_GOVERNANCE_UPDATE_RECIPE` transaction type. Logs from failing DA nodes show 'INVALID_BLOCK_SIZE' errors, suggesting they are receiving blocks that violate the protocol's size constraints.

## Your Task

Investigate the root cause of the intermittent 'INVALID_BLOCK_SIZE' consensus failures. Your primary objective is to identify the exact file and line(s) of code causing this bug. Your analysis should explain:
1. Why are blocks being created with an incorrect size?
2. Why does this issue only manifest when using the `da_strategy` and not the `pos_strategy`?
3. Why is the bug triggered by `TX_GOVERNANCE_UPDATE_RECIPE` transactions specifically?

Your final output should be a clear explanation of the root cause. You do not need to provide a patch, but describing the necessary fix is a plus.

## Expected Approach

An expert developer would approach this systematically:
1. **Triage the Error:** The log message 'INVALID_BLOCK_SIZE' from a node running `da_strategy` is the starting point. The first file to inspect should be `HoloCanvas//services//ledger_core//src//strategies//da_strategy.c` to see how and where this validation occurs.
2. **Trace the Block's Origin:** The validation function in `da_strategy.c` receives a fully formed block. The developer would trace backwards to find the source of this block. This path leads from the consensus strategy, through the `consensus_manager.c`, to the `block_builder.c` service, which is responsible for assembling transactions into a new block.
3. **Analyze Block Construction Logic:** The core investigation should happen in `HoloCanvas//services//ledger_core//src//block_builder.c`. The developer would analyze the main function responsible for creating a block, likely a loop that iterates through transactions from the mempool and adds them to the block structure.
4. **Identify the Flaw:** The developer should scrutinize how the block's total size is calculated as transactions are added. They would notice different logic for different transaction types. For the `TX_GOVERNANCE_UPDATE_RECIPE` transaction type, they would find a subtle but critical C programming error: the code uses `sizeof(tx->payload)` to get the size of the transaction's data. Since `tx->payload` is likely a pointer (`char*` or `uint8_t*`), `sizeof()` will return the size of the pointer itself (e.g., 8 bytes on a 64-bit system), not the size of the data it points to. This leads to a gross underestimation of the transaction's actual size.
5. **Compare Consensus Strategies:** To answer why PoS works, the developer would compare `da_strategy.c` with `pos_strategy.c`. They would discover that the block validation logic in `pos_strategy.c` is either missing the block size check entirely or has a much higher, more permissive threshold, effectively masking the bug from the `block_builder`.
6. **Synthesize Findings:** The developer would conclude that the root cause is a faulty size calculation in `block_builder.c` for a specific transaction type. This faulty calculation creates oversized blocks, which are then correctly rejected by the strict `da_strategy` but incorrectly accepted by the lenient `pos_strategy`.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctly identifies `block_builder.c` as the file containing the root cause of the invalid block creation.
- Correctly pinpoints the specific line of code using `sizeof(pointer)` as the bug.
- Accurately explains *why* `sizeof(pointer)` is incorrect in this context (i.e., it measures pointer size, not buffer size).
- Correctly identifies the lack of validation in `pos_strategy.c` as the reason for the discrepancy between consensus engines.
- Demonstrates an efficient investigation path, starting from the error logs and logically tracing back to the source, without getting sidetracked by irrelevant services like `mint_factory` or `wallet_proxy`.
- Provides a clear, coherent, and complete explanation of the entire bug lifecycle, from transaction creation to consensus failure.
