# FlockDesk Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
_Last updated: 2024-06-09_

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the **FlockDesk** project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
* Showing empathy toward other community members
* Using inclusive language that avoids ableist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory terms

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all **FlockDesk** project spaces—GitHub/GitLab repositories, issue trackers, mailing lists, Discord/Slack channels, real-time collaborative Jam sessions, and in-person events—and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Responsibilities and Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, as well as to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the **FlockDesk** steering committee as soon as possible by emailing: **conduct@flockdesk.org**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The steering committee is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Process
1. **Receipt & Acknowledgement**  
   A maintainer will acknowledge the report within 24 hours and begin an investigation.
2. **Investigation**  
   The committee may ask clarifying questions and gather additional information.
3. **Decision & Action**  
   Possible outcomes include a request for apology, removal of content, temporary or permanent ban, or no action if deemed unfounded.
4. **Communication**  
   The decision will be communicated to the reporter and, where appropriate, to the community.
