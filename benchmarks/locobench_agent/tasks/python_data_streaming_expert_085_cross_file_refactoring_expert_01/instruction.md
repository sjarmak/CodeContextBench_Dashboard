## Task Title

Consolidate Dispersed Data Validation Logic into a Centralized Framework

## Description

The PulseStream Nexus data streaming platform has evolved over several years, with different teams contributing various data ingestion pipelines. A significant source of technical debt is the inconsistent and duplicated data validation logic scattered across multiple modules. For example, `module_19` (user profile ingestion), `module_73` (transaction processing), and `module_30` (event log handling) each implement their own ad-hoc functions for checking nulls, validating data types, and verifying string formats using regular expressions. This inconsistency makes the system difficult to maintain, test, and extend. The objective is to refactor this fragmented logic into a single, unified, and extensible data validation framework.

## Your Task

Your task is to refactor the data validation logic within the PulseStream Nexus application. You must centralize the disparate validation checks into a new, dedicated validation framework.

1.  **Analyze the Codebase:** Examine `src/module_19.py`, `src/module_73.py`, `src/module_30.py`, and `src/utils.py` to identify all functions and inline code blocks responsible for data validation. Look for patterns like null checks, type assertions (`isinstance`), and regex matching for fields like emails, UUIDs, and timestamps.

2.  **Design and Implement a Validation Framework:**
    *   Create a new directory `src/validation/`.
    *   Inside this directory, create a new file `core.py` to house the framework.
    *   Design a class-based framework. It should include a base `Validator` abstract class and concrete implementations for common rules (e.g., `NotNullValidator`, `TypeValidator`, `RegexValidator`, `TimestampFormatValidator`).
    *   The framework should allow for the composition of these validators to check a complete data record or dictionary.
    *   Create a custom exception file `src/validation/exceptions.py` with a `ValidationError` class for standardized error handling.

3.  **Refactor Existing Modules:**
    *   Modify `src/module_19.py`, `src/module_73.py`, and `src/module_30.py` to use your new validation framework.
    *   Remove the old, ad-hoc validation functions and inline checks from these modules.
    *   Replace them with calls to your new, centralized validation logic from `src/validation/core.py`.

4.  **Ensure Integrity:** The refactoring must not alter the application's core logic. Data that was previously considered valid must remain valid, and data that was previously rejected must still be rejected, now by raising the new `ValidationError`.

## Expected Approach

An expert developer would approach this task systematically:

1.  **Discovery:** Use code searching tools (like `grep` or an IDE's find-in-files feature) to locate validation-related code. They would search for keywords like `validate`, `check_`, `is_valid`, `isinstance`, `re.match`, and common field names like `user_id`, `email`, `timestamp`, `amount` across the specified files.

2.  **Categorization:** Group the findings into logical categories: presence checks, type checks, format/regex checks, range checks, etc. This informs the design of the new framework.

3.  **Framework Design:** Design a flexible and extensible abstraction. A common pattern is the Strategy or Specification pattern. This involves creating a base `Validator` class with a `validate(data)` method. Concrete classes like `NotNullValidator('field_name')` or `RegexValidator('email', r'...')` would inherit from this base. A composer class, like `SchemaValidator([validator1, validator2])`, would be used to apply a set of rules to a data object.

4.  **Implementation:** Create the `src/validation/` directory and files (`core.py`, `exceptions.py`). Implement the designed base classes, concrete validator classes, and the custom `ValidationError`.

5.  **Incremental Refactoring:** Refactor one module at a time to minimize risk. For example, start with `module_19.py`. Replace its internal validation logic with a new `SchemaValidator` instance configured with the appropriate rules. Add the necessary `import` statements at the top of the file.

6.  **Deletion of Dead Code:** After confirming the new implementation works as expected for a given module, confidently delete the old, now-unnecessary validation functions and code blocks.

7.  **Repeat and Verify:** Repeat the refactoring process for `module_73.py`, `module_30.py`, and any relevant functions found in `utils.py`. The final step is a thorough review to ensure all call sites are updated and no legacy validation logic remains in the refactored modules.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness of Abstraction:** The new framework in `src/validation/core.py` is well-designed, reusable, and follows good object-oriented principles.
- **Completeness of Refactoring:** All specified ad-hoc validation logic in `module_19`, `module_73`, and `module_30` has been successfully replaced.
- **Code Removal:** The old, redundant validation functions and inline checks have been completely removed from the refactored modules.
- **Functional Equivalence:** The system's validation behavior is preserved. No valid data is incorrectly rejected, and no invalid data is incorrectly accepted.
- **Cross-File Consistency:** The new validation framework is used consistently across all refactored files, including correct import statements.
- **Absence of Regressions:** The agent did not introduce syntax errors, break existing imports, or negatively impact other, unrelated parts of the codebase.

## Instructions

1. Explore the codebase in `/app/project/` to understand the existing implementation
2. Use MCP tools for efficient code navigation and understanding
3. Provide your solution in `/app/solution.md`

Your response should:
- Be comprehensive and address all aspects of the task
- Reference specific files and code sections where relevant
- Provide concrete recommendations or implementations as requested
- Consider the architectural implications of your solution

## Output Format

Write your complete solution to `/app/solution.md`. Include:
- Your analysis and reasoning
- Specific file paths and code references
- Any code changes or implementations (as applicable)
- Your final answer or recommendations
