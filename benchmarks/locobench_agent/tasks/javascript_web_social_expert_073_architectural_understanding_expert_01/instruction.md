## Task Title

Analyze Performance Bottleneck in Asynchronous User Progress Update Flow

## Description

The PulseLearn Campus Hub is a complex, microservices-based e-learning platform. The architecture leverages event-driven patterns using Kafka to ensure services are loosely coupled and scalable, as detailed in the project's Architectural Decision Records (ADRs). Recently, users have reported a significant and intermittent delay: after they complete a course lecture or quiz, it can sometimes take up to a minute for their progress to be reflected on their main dashboard's progress chart and activity stream. This delay is causing user frustration and appears to worsen during peak usage hours. As an expert architect, you need to analyze the system to identify the likely cause of this latency.

## Your Task

Your task is to perform a root cause analysis of the user progress update latency. You must not write or modify any code. Instead, produce a detailed architectural analysis report in markdown format. 

The report must:
1.  **Trace the complete, end-to-end data flow.** Start from the user's action in the frontend (e.g., completing a lecture in `LecturePlayer.js`), through the API Gateway, to all relevant backend services, and finally back to the frontend components that display the progress (`ProgressChart.js`, `ActivityStream.js`). Clearly distinguish between synchronous API calls and asynchronous event-driven messages.
2.  **Identify the key architectural components involved.** List the specific services, databases, message brokers, and critical code modules (e.g., controllers, services, repositories, event producers/consumers) that participate in this flow.
3.  **Pinpoint the top 3 most likely architectural areas causing the delay.** For each potential bottleneck, provide a detailed justification referencing specific files (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`, `nginx.conf`, service code, or ADRs) and architectural patterns (e.g., eventual consistency, producer/consumer configuration) that support your hypothesis.

## Expected Approach

An expert developer would approach this by systemically tracing the data flow and reasoning about the system's design trade-offs.

1.  **Start at the UI:** Examine `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.js` and its child components like `frontend/src/components/dashboard/ProgressChart.js` to see how they fetch data. This will likely lead to `frontend/src/services/courseService.js` or a similar client.
2.  **Trace the 'Write' Path:** Hypothesize that completing a lecture triggers a POST/PUT request. Look in `frontend/src/components/course/LecturePlayer.js` for an API call that updates progress.
3.  **Follow to the Backend:** Trace this API call through the `services/api-gateway/nginx.conf` to its destination, the `course-service`.
4.  **Analyze the Core Service Logic:** Inside `course-service`, inspect the relevant controller (`courseController.js`), service (`courseService.js`), and repository (`courseRepository.js`) to see how the progress update is persisted to its database (`schema.prisma`).
5.  **Identify the Asynchronous Link:** Crucially, the developer must consult the documentation, specifically `docs/ADR/002-event-sourcing-with-kafka.md`, to understand that cross-service communication happens via events. They would then look for an event being published in `course-service` after the database write, likely in `services/course-service/src/events/producer.js`.
6.  **Analyze the 'Read' Path:** Return to the dashboard components. How do they get the updated data? They likely poll the `course-service` periodically for the latest progress. The delay is the time between the 'write' action and the next successful 'read' poll that reflects the new data.
7.  **Synthesize Bottlenecks:** The 'intermittent' and 'under load' nature of the problem strongly points away from simple synchronous code and towards the asynchronous messaging system or infrastructure contention. The expert would identify Kafka as the most likely source of variable delay. They would formulate hypotheses based on common failure modes in event-driven systems: producer performance, broker load, and consumer lag. They would also consider the frontend polling strategy as a contributor to perceived latency.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Flow Tracing Accuracy:** Correctly identifies and separates the synchronous write, asynchronous event, and frontend read paths.
- **Component Identification:** Accurately lists the critical services, infrastructure, and specific files involved in the process.
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** Cites specific files (`docker-compose.yml`, ADRs, service code) to justify conclusions.
- **Problem Diagnosis:** Correctly identifies the asynchronous, event-driven nature of the architecture (`eventual consistency`) as the root cause of the *type* of delay.
- **Bottleneck Plausibility:** Proposes at least two plausible, architecturally-sound bottlenecks (e.g., Kafka contention, frontend polling, DB load).
- **Understanding of Trade-offs:** Demonstrates an understanding that this latency is a trade-off inherent in the chosen loosely-coupled, event-driven architecture.

## Instructions
