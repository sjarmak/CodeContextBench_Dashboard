## Task Title

Architectural Proposal for Real-Time 'Hardcore Mode' Sync

## Description

The TycoonVerse project team wants to introduce a new 'Hardcore Mode' for highly competitive players. A key requirement for this mode is that all significant player actions (e.g., constructing a building, making a market trade) must be synchronized with the server in real-time. This presents a major architectural challenge, as the current system is built on an offline-first strategy, where actions are queued locally and synchronized periodically. This design is explicitly documented in ADR-003. The agent must analyze the existing architecture and propose a design to accommodate this new, conflicting requirement while preserving the existing offline functionality for standard players.

## Your Task

As the lead architect, you are tasked with designing a solution to support a real-time 'Hardcore Mode'. Your proposal must not be a full implementation, but rather a high-level architectural plan. Your plan should be presented as a clear, structured analysis that addresses the following points:

1.  **Analysis of Conflict**: Briefly explain why the 'Hardcore Mode' requirement conflicts with the current architecture, referencing `ADR-003-Offline-Sync-Strategy.md` and relevant source code files.

2.  **Proposed Architectural Pattern**: Identify and justify the primary design pattern(s) (e.g., Strategy, Decorator, etc.) you would use to implement the conditional sync logic. Explain why your chosen pattern is superior to a naive approach (e.g., adding `if (isHardcore)` checks in every command handler).

3.  **Component Placement and Responsibility**: Detail where new classes and interfaces should be created within the existing project structure (`Core`, `Application`, `Infrastructure`). List the key existing classes that will require modification.

4.  **Decision Logic**: Describe how the system will determine which synchronization path (real-time vs. offline-queued) to use for a given player action. Pinpoint the specific class or component that will be responsible for making this decision.

## Expected Approach

An expert developer would approach this task by first understanding the established architectural principles before considering any changes. 

1.  **Documentation Review**: The first step is to thoroughly read the architectural documentation, specifically `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/design/ADR-001-Layered-Architecture.md`, and most importantly, `docs/design/ADR-003-Offline-Sync-Strategy.md`. This provides the 'why' behind the current implementation.

2.  **Code Investigation**: The developer would then trace the current offline sync flow. This would involve examining how a command (e.g., `CreateCompanyCommand`) is handled, how it's likely added to a local queue (potentially via a Unit of Work or a dedicated queuing service), and how `SyncPlayerActionsCommand.cs` eventually processes this queue and sends data to the server via `ApiClient.cs`.

3.  **Pattern Identification**: Recognizing that adding `if/else` statements for the mode in every command handler would violate the Open/Closed Principle and lead to fragile code, the developer would look for a behavioral design pattern. The **Strategy Pattern** is the most natural fit. This pattern allows for defining a family of algorithms (syncing strategies), encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. 

4.  **Solution Design**: The developer would formulate a plan based on the Strategy pattern:
    *   Define a new abstraction for the sync behavior, like `IActionSyncStrategy`, within the `TycoonVerse.Application/Interfaces` layer.
    *   Create two concrete implementations: 
        *   `OfflineQueuingStrategy`: Encapsulates the existing logic of saving actions to the local database for later sync.
        *   `RealTimeSyncStrategy`: Implements the new logic, directly calling the `ApiClient` to send the action to the server.
    *   Propose a factory or use the existing `ServiceLocator` to create and inject the correct strategy into the command handlers based on the current player's state (e.g., a new `Player.GameMode` property).
    *   Identify that the command handlers (e.g., `CreateCompanyCommand`, `AuthenticatePlayerCommand`) are the primary clients of this strategy and would need to be modified to use the `IActionSyncStrategy` interface.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **ADR Comprehension**: Assesses if the agent correctly identifies and explains the conflict with the architecture described in `ADR-003-Offline-Sync-Strategy.md`.
- **Architectural Pattern Selection**: Evaluates the agent's ability to choose and justify an appropriate, scalable design pattern (like Strategy) over a naive, brittle solution.
- **Layer Adherence**: Measures whether the proposed new components and modifications respect the project's established layered architecture (e.g., interfaces in Application, implementations using external services in Infrastructure).
- **Impact Analysis**: Checks if the agent accurately identifies the key existing classes and layers that will be impacted by the change.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Assesses if the proposed solution correctly separates the decision-making logic (the factory) from the action execution logic (the command handlers and strategies).
- **Clarity and Justification**: Evaluates the overall quality of the explanation, including the reasoning behind architectural choices.

## Instructions
