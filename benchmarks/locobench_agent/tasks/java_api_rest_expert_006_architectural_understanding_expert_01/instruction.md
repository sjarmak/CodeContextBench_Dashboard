## Task Title

Architectural Analysis for a New Cross-Service Orchestration Feature

## Description

The OpsForge Utility Nexus is a complex microservices-based system designed to provide various backend utility functions. The architecture follows established patterns including an API Gateway for ingress, a Service Discovery registry, a centralized Config Server, and a shared common library for cross-cutting concerns. The individual microservices (e.g., `file-converter-service`, `data-anonymizer-service`) are built using a Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters), as documented in the project's ADRs. The system currently supports independent, synchronous REST calls and some asynchronous, event-driven interactions for specific services. A new business requirement has emerged to support complex, multi-step, asynchronous workflows that combine the capabilities of existing services.

## Your Task

You are a senior architect tasked with designing a solution for a new 'Data Processing Pipeline' feature. This feature must allow users to submit a job that executes a sequence of operations across multiple services. For example, a pipeline might first anonymize a dataset using the `data-anonymizer-service` and then convert the resulting data into a different format using the `file-converter-service`.

Your task is to produce a high-level architectural proposal. You are not required to write the full implementation, but you must demonstrate a deep understanding of the existing system to ensure your proposal is consistent and viable.

Your analysis must include:
1.  A brief summary of the current architecture's key components and communication patterns.
2.  A proposal for implementing the new 'Data Processing Pipeline' feature. Your proposal should address where the orchestration logic should live (e.g., in a new service or an existing one) and justify your choice by analyzing architectural trade-offs (e.g., Orchestration vs. Choreography).
3.  A detailed description of the data flow and component interactions for a sample pipeline job (e.g., Anonymize then Convert). This should cover the initial request, state management, inter-service communication, and how the final result is made available to the user.
4.  A list of the key new modules/files that would need to be created and a list of existing files that would require significant modification to implement your proposed design.

## Expected Approach

An expert developer would first seek to understand the macro- and micro-architectures of the system.

1.  **Macro-architecture Review:** The developer would start by examining `docker-compose.yml`, the root `pom.xml`, and the ADRs (`001-architectural-style-microservices.md`, `002-hexagonal-architecture-for-services.md`). This would reveal the microservice nature of the system, the key infrastructure components (API Gateway, Service Discovery, Config Server), and the overarching design philosophy.

2.  **Micro-architecture Deep Dive:** The developer would then inspect a representative service, like `file-converter-service`. They would analyze its `pom.xml` (dependencies), its configuration (`application.yml`, `bootstrap.yml`), and its source code structure. They would identify the Hexagonal Architecture implementation by looking at the `domain`, `adapter`, and `port` packages. They would note the existence of both inbound web adapters (`FileConversionController`) and inbound messaging adapters (`FileConversionMessageListener`), indicating the system handles both synchronous and asynchronous requests.

3.  **Design & Trade-off Analysis:** With this context, the developer would evaluate options for the new pipeline:
    *   **Choreography:** One service emits an event, and another service reacts to it. For a multi-step pipeline, this would create a chain of events (e.g., `AnonymizationComplete` event triggers the file converter). This is loosely coupled but makes the overall workflow implicit and hard to monitor or debug, especially for error handling (e.g., what if step 2 of 3 fails?).
    *   **Orchestration:** A central component actively manages the workflow, calling each service in sequence and handling the state. This is more tightly coupled to the workflow logic but makes the process explicit, easier to manage, monitor, and add complex logic like retries or compensation actions.

4.  **Conclusion:** For a defined, stateful, multi-step business process, orchestration is the superior pattern. The developer would propose creating a new `pipeline-orchestrator-service`.

5.  **Proposal Detailing:** The developer would then outline this new service. It would be a new Spring Boot application, follow the Hexagonal pattern, register with the service discovery, and pull from the config server. It would expose a REST endpoint for starting and monitoring jobs. Internally, its 'outbound adapters' would be HTTP clients responsible for communicating with the other utility services (anonymizer, converter, etc.). The developer would also detail the flow: a client gets a `jobId` back immediately, and the orchestrator service handles the long-running process, allowing the client to poll for status using the `jobId`.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Component Identification:** Correctly identifies the roles of the API Gateway, Service Discovery, Config Server, and individual microservices.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Explicitly recognizes and references the Microservices and Hexagonal Architecture patterns guiding the system's design.
- **Architectural Trade-off Analysis:** Accurately discusses the pros and cons of Orchestration vs. Choreography in the context of this specific problem.
- **Solution Cohesion:** Proposes a solution (the new service) that aligns with the existing architectural patterns (Hexagonal, uses discovery/config) rather than introducing a conflicting design.
- **Impact Analysis:** Correctly identifies the need for a new service module and pinpoints the key existing files (`pom.xml`, `GatewayRouteConfig.java`, `docker-compose.yml`) that must be modified.
- **Flow Description:** Provides a clear, logical, and technically sound description of the end-to-end data flow for the new feature, including its asynchronous nature.

## Instructions

1. Explore the codebase in `/app/project/` to understand the existing implementation
