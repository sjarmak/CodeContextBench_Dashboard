    "current_flow_analysis": "The `TransformationWorker` class in the `PaletteStream.Transformer` service, after processing data, serializes the entire resulting DataFrame. It then constructs a `DataTransformedEvent` (defined in `src/Shared/PaletteStream.Shared.Events/DataEvents.cs`) and embeds this large serialized payload into the event. This event is published to the `palette-data-transformed` Kafka topic using the `KafkaProducer`. The `QualityCheckRunner` class in the `PaletteStream.Quality` service is a consumer of this topic. It receives the `DataTransformedEvent`, deserializes the large payload back into a DataFrame, and then proceeds with the quality checks.",
    "bottleneck_explanation": "Sending large payloads (1GB+) via Kafka is a bottleneck due to: \n1. **Message Size Limits:** Kafka has a configurable but practical limit on message size (`message.max.bytes`). Exceeding this causes failures.\n2. **Broker/Network Strain:** Pushing large messages consumes significant network bandwidth and puts heavy memory/IO pressure on the Kafka brokers, slowing down the entire event bus for all services.\n3. **Serialization/Deserialization Overhead:** The CPU and memory cost of serializing and deserializing gigabyte-scale objects in both the producer (`Transformer`) and consumer (`Quality`) services is substantial and adds significant latency.\n4. **Consumer Lag:** A consumer taking a long time to process one large message can cause consumer lag, delaying the processing of all subsequent messages in its partition.",

        "A modified `DataTransformedEvent` is published to Kafka. This event is now lightweight and contains metadata and the 'claim check' URI instead of the full data payload.",
