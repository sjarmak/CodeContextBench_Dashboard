## Task Title

Architectural Refactoring: Decompose Monitoring Module into a Microservice

## Description

CanvasCraft ML Studio is currently architected as a C# modular monolith. A key business requirement has emerged to scale the model monitoring capabilities independently from the core application. The `CanvasCraft.Monitoring` module, which is responsible for detecting data drift and performance degradation in deployed models, has been identified as a prime candidate for extraction into a separate microservice. This task requires the agent to analyze the existing architecture and formulate a detailed plan for this decomposition.

## Your Task

You are a senior software architect. Your task is to create a detailed architectural refactoring plan to extract the `CanvasCraft.Monitoring` project into a new, standalone microservice. Your plan must be based on a thorough analysis of the existing codebase and architectural documents.

Your final output should be a technical plan that addresses the following points:

1.  **Analysis of Current State:** Briefly describe how the monitoring system currently works within the modular monolith. Identify the key components involved and their interaction patterns (e.g., how monitoring is triggered and how its results are consumed).

2.  **Proposed Microservice Architecture:**
    a.  **Communication Strategy:** Define how the new `MonitoringService` will communicate with the main `CanvasCraft.Api` application. Justify your choice of communication pattern (e.g., synchronous vs. asynchronous) by referencing existing patterns in the codebase.
    b.  **Data Flow:** Detail the flow of data and events between the main application and the new microservice. Specifically, explain what triggers the monitoring logic and how the results (e.g., a detected drift) are communicated back to the system to trigger actions like automated retraining.

3.  **Implementation & Refactoring Plan:**
    a.  **Code Changes:** List the primary projects and specific files/classes in the existing solution that will require modification. Describe the nature of the changes needed (e.g., removal of code, modification of a service client).
    b.  **New Components:** Describe the high-level structure of the new `MonitoringService`, including its API contract if it requires one.
    c.  **Deployment:** Explain how the `docker-compose.yml` file should be updated to include the new microservice for local development and testing.

## Expected Approach

An expert developer would approach this task by first building a mental model of the system, synthesizing information from both documentation and code.

1.  **Documentation Review:** The developer would start by reading the architecture documents, specifically `docs/architecture/adr/001-modular-monolith-architecture.md` and `docs/architecture/adr/002-event-driven-monitoring.md`. This provides the high-level context that the system is intentionally designed as a modular monolith and uses event-driven patterns for decoupling.

2.  **Code Analysis - Triggering Monitoring:** The developer would trace the execution path for model predictions. They would look at `CanvasCraft.Api/Controllers/ServingController.cs` to see how predictions are handled. They would likely find that it publishes an event, such as `ModelPredictionQueriedEvent`, onto a message bus.

3.  **Code Analysis - Monitoring Logic:** Next, they would examine the `CanvasCraft.Monitoring` project. They'd identify that it uses an Observer pattern (`IModelObserver`, `ModelServingSubject`) and is likely running as a background service within the main monolith, subscribing to the events published by the API via `IMessageBus` (implemented by `RabbitMqService.cs`). The observers (`DataDriftObserver`, `PerformanceFadeObserver`) contain the core detection logic.

4.  **Code Analysis - Consuming Results:** The developer would investigate how monitoring results are used. They would find the `CanvasCraft.Pipeline/Triggers/AutomatedRetrainingTrigger.cs` and determine how it's activated. It's likely that the observers, upon detecting an issue, publish a *new* event (e.g., `DriftDetectedEvent`, `RetrainingRequiredEvent`) to the message bus, which the `AutomatedRetrainingTrigger` subscribes to.

5.  **Formulating the Plan:** Based on this analysis, the developer would formulate the plan:
    *   Propose that the new microservice will contain the code from the `CanvasCraft.Monitoring` project.
    *   Confirm that the communication should remain asynchronous using the existing RabbitMQ infrastructure to maintain loose coupling, as established in the ADRs.
    *   The main API's responsibility remains unchanged: publish prediction events.
    *   The new `MonitoringService` will be the sole subscriber to these prediction events.
    *   The `MonitoringService`, upon detecting an issue, will publish a `RetrainingRequiredEvent` (or similar) back to RabbitMQ.
    *   The `AutomatedRetrainingTrigger` in the main application's `Pipeline` module will remain, but its subscription logic will now listen for events from the external service rather than an in-process source.
    *   The `docker-compose.yml` file will be modified to add a new service definition for the `monitoring-service`, configuring its build context, network, and environment variables (e.g., RabbitMQ connection string).
    *   Identify that `CanvasCraft.Api/Startup.cs` will need to be cleaned up to remove the DI registration for the monitoring observers.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctly identifies the existing architecture as a modular monolith with event-driven communication via RabbitMQ.
- Accurately describes the current data flow from API event publication to monitoring consumption and subsequent trigger activation.
- Proposes a viable, asynchronous communication pattern for the new microservice that leverages existing infrastructure (RabbitMQ).
- Clearly defines the responsibilities of both the main application and the new microservice in the proposed architecture.
- Correctly identifies the full-circle event path, including how monitoring results are communicated back to trigger retraining.
- Lists the key files/areas for modification, including `Startup.cs` (DI removal), project references, and `docker-compose.yml`.
- Demonstrates an understanding of microservice principles by creating a plan that promotes loose coupling and independent deployment.
