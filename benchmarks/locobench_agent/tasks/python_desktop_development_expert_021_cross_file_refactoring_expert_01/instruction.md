## Task Title

Refactor User State Management by Unifying Profile and Presence Services

## Description

In the FlockDesk application, user-related data is currently fragmented across two distinct services: `ProfileService` handles static user data like names and avatars, while `PresenceService` manages dynamic real-time data like online status. This separation leads to several architectural problems: components needing a complete user view must interact with two different services, increasing complexity and coupling. It also creates a risk of data inconsistency and makes state management more difficult. This task involves a major architectural refactoring to consolidate these two services into a single, authoritative `UserService`, creating a single source of truth for all user information.

## Your Task

Your task is to refactor the user management system by unifying `ProfileService` and `PresenceService`.

1.  **Create a New Service:** Create a new file at `flockdesk/core/services/user_service.py`. Inside this file, define a new `UserService` class. This class will be the new single source of truth for all user data.

2.  **Consolidate Logic:** Migrate all functionality from `flockdesk/core/services/profile_service.py` and `flockdesk/modules/presence/service.py` into the new `UserService`. The new service should manage both static profile data (e.g., from `shared/schemas/user_profile.py`) and dynamic status data (e.g., from `modules/presence/model/user_status.py`). Design a unified API, for example, a method `get_user_view(user_id)` that returns a combined object/dictionary with the user's name, avatar, and current online status.

3.  **Update Consumers:** Systematically refactor all application components that currently depend on `ProfileService` or `PresenceService`. They must now import and use the new `UserService`. Key files to investigate include, but are not limited to:
    *   `flockdesk/modules/chat/viewmodel/chat_vm.py`
    *   `flockdesk/modules/presence/viewmodel/presence_vm.py`
    *   `flockdesk/modules/presence/view/presence_widget.py`
    *   `flockdesk/shared/widgets/avatar_widget.py`
    *   `flockdesk/core/app.py` (for service initialization)

4.  **Update Tests:** Adapt the existing tests to reflect this new architecture. You may need to merge tests from `tests/integration/test_profile_sync.py` and create a new test file like `tests/unit/core/test_user_service.py`. Ensure the core functionality remains tested.

5.  **Cleanup:** Once all references have been updated and the application is stable, delete the now-redundant files: `flockdesk/core/services/profile_service.py` and `flockdesk/modules/presence/service.py`.

## Expected Approach

An expert developer would approach this task methodically:

1.  **Analysis Phase:** 
    *   Thoroughly read `profile_service.py` and `presence/service.py` to understand their public APIs, internal state, and responsibilities.
    *   Use a global search (e.g., `grep` or IDE search) for `ProfileService` and `PresenceService` to identify all call sites and points of dependency injection across the codebase.
    *   Analyze how these services are instantiated and registered, likely within `flockdesk/core/app.py` or `flockdesk/core/main.py`.

2.  **Design Phase:**
    *   Design the public API for the new `UserService`. It should provide clear, consolidated methods like `get_current_user_profile()`, `get_user_view(user_id)`, `observe_user_status(user_id, callback)`, and `set_my_status(new_status)`.
    *   Plan for the service to be a singleton, likely following the pattern in `shared/utils/singleton.py` if used elsewhere.
    *   Decide on an internal data structure, probably a dictionary, to cache user data, combining profile and status information.

3.  **Implementation Phase (Incremental):**
    *   Create the new file `flockdesk/core/services/user_service.py` and the `UserService` class skeleton.
    *   Begin by migrating the logic from `ProfileService` and `PresenceService` into the new `UserService`, adapting method signatures and internal logic to coexist.
    *   Update the service instantiation logic in `app.py` or `main.py` to create `UserService` and remove the old services. This is a critical step to ensure the new service is available for dependency injection.
    *   Refactor consumers one by one. For each file that uses an old service, change the import, update the dependency injection (if applicable), and modify the method calls to use the new `UserService` API.
    *   Run relevant unit tests frequently during this process to catch regressions early.

4.  **Testing Phase:**
    *   Create `tests/unit/core/test_user_service.py`. Port and adapt relevant tests from the old services' test files.
    *   Write new tests for the unified API methods.
    *   Modify existing integration tests like `test_profile_sync.py` to use the new service, or merge its functionality into a new integration test for `UserService`.
    *   Run the entire test suite to ensure the refactoring is complete and correct.

5.  **Cleanup Phase:**
    *   After all tests pass and all references are updated, confidently delete `flockdesk/core/services/profile_service.py` and `flockdesk/modules/presence/service.py`.
    *   Delete their corresponding test files if they are no longer needed.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness & Functionality:** The application must compile and run without errors. All user-related features (displaying avatars, names, online statuses) must work as before. All tests in the suite must pass.
- **Completeness of Refactoring:** All usages of `ProfileService` and `PresenceService` must be successfully replaced with `UserService`. The two old service files must be deleted.
- **Architectural Soundness:** The new `UserService` must be well-designed, providing a clean and unified API that effectively encapsulates the combined responsibilities of the former services.
- **Code Quality:** The new and modified code must adhere to existing project conventions, be readable, and not introduce new bugs or code smells.
- **Test Maintenance:** The agent must demonstrate an ability to manage the test suite by creating, modifying, and deleting test files and test cases as appropriate for the refactoring.
- **File System Operations:** The agent must correctly create the new service file in the specified location and correctly delete the old files without leaving orphans or deleting incorrect files.
