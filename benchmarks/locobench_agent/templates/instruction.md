## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Understand the Task Type

**For Code Understanding/Analysis Tasks** (architectural_understanding, bug_investigation):
- Focus on exploring and analyzing the codebase
- Document your findings thoroughly in solution.md

**For Code Modification Tasks** (cross_file_refactoring, feature_implementation):
- **IMPLEMENT the code changes directly in /app/project/**
- Then document your changes in solution.md
- Your actual code modifications will be evaluated

### Step 2: Use Deep Search MCP for Code Discovery

You have access to the deepsearch MCP server. Use it for intelligent code search:

**Repository**: {github_org}/{github_repo}

When making Deep Search queries, ALWAYS reference the repository:
- "In {github_org}/{github_repo}, where is the authentication logic?"
- "Search {github_org}/{github_repo} for error handling patterns"
- "In {github_org}/{github_repo}, how does the data flow from X to Y?"

### Step 3: Explore the Codebase

The repository is mounted at /app/project/. Use file exploration tools to:
- Understand directory structure
- Read relevant source files
- Trace dependencies and relationships

### Step 4: Write Your Solution

**OUTPUT FILE**: /logs/agent/solution.md

Your solution **MUST** include ALL of the following sections:

---

## Required Solution Structure

When writing your solution.md, use this exact structure:

# Solution: [Task ID]

## Key Files Identified

List ALL relevant files with their full paths and descriptions:
- /app/project/path/to/file1.ext - Brief description of relevance
- /app/project/path/to/file2.ext - Brief description of relevance
- /app/project/path/to/file3.ext - Brief description of relevance

## Code Evidence

Include relevant code blocks that support your analysis.
For each code block, include a comment with the file path and line numbers.
Example format:
  // File: /app/project/src/module/file.ts
  // Lines: 42-58
  [paste the relevant code here]

## Analysis

Detailed explanation of your findings:
- How the components interact
- The architectural patterns used
- Dependencies and relationships identified
- For bugs: root cause analysis
- For refactoring: impact assessment

## Implementation (For Code Modification Tasks)

If this is a code modification task, describe the changes you made:
- Files modified: list each file
- Changes made: describe each modification
- Testing: how you verified the changes work

## Summary

Concise answer addressing the original question:
- **Primary finding**: [main answer to the task question]
- **Key components**: [list major files/modules involved]
- **Architectural pattern**: [pattern or approach identified]
- **Recommendations**: [if applicable]

---

## Important Requirements

1. **Include file paths exactly as they appear** in the repository (e.g., /app/project/src/auth/handler.ts)

2. **Use code blocks** with the language specified to show evidence from the codebase

3. **For code modification tasks**: 
   - First implement changes in /app/project/
   - Then document what you changed in solution.md
   - Include before/after code snippets

4. **Be thorough but focused** - address the specific question asked

5. **The Summary section must contain key technical terms** relevant to the answer (these are used for evaluation)

## Output Path Reminder

**CRITICAL**: Write your complete solution to /logs/agent/solution.md

Do NOT write to /app/solution.md - use /logs/agent/solution.md
