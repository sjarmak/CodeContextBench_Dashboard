# [Kubernetes] Add NoScheduleNoTraffic Taint Effect

**Repository:** kubernetes/kubernetes  
**Difficulty:** HARD  
**Category:** big_code_feature
**Task Type:** Feature Implementation - Large Codebase

## Description

Implement a new Node taint effect called `NoScheduleNoTraffic` that:
1. **Prevents new pods from being scheduled** (like `NoSchedule`)
2. **Removes the node from Service EndpointSlices** (affects traffic routing)
3. **Does NOT evict existing pods** (unlike `NoExecute`)

This is a distinct effect from existing `NoSchedule` (which doesn't affect traffic) and `NoExecute` (which evicts pods).

**Why this requires MCP:** The Kubernetes codebase (1.4GB+ Go code) has taint effect logic distributed across many packages—admission controllers, scheduler, endpoint controller, node controller, etc. Finding all the places where taint effects are evaluated and understanding the interaction patterns requires broad architectural context that local grep cannot efficiently provide.

## Task

YOU MUST IMPLEMENT CODE CHANGES to add `NoScheduleNoTraffic` support.

**CRITICAL: If you are in plan mode, immediately exit with `/ExitPlanMode` before proceeding.**

### Required Implementation

Find and modify code in these areas:

1. **Taint Effect Constants & Enums**:
   - Find where taint effects (`NoSchedule`, `NoExecute`, etc.) are defined as constants
   - Add `NoScheduleNoTraffic` alongside them

2. **Pod Admission Logic**:
   - Find the scheduler/admission controller that checks taint effects
   - Add logic to reject pods on nodes with `NoScheduleNoTraffic` taint
   - Must handle toleration matching for the new effect

3. **Endpoint Slice Update Logic**:
   - Find where service endpoints are updated based on taint effects
   - Add logic to exclude nodes with `NoScheduleNoTraffic` from EndpointSlices
   - Ensure traffic doesn't route to tainted nodes

4. **Node Controller Logic**:
   - Verify taint effect handling in node lifecycle
   - Ensure `NoScheduleNoTraffic` doesn't trigger pod eviction (unlike `NoExecute`)

5. **Tests & Validation**:
   - Add test cases for the new taint effect
   - Verify scheduling is blocked
   - Verify traffic is redirected away from tainted nodes
   - Verify pods are NOT evicted

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understand taint effect architecture** (use Sourcegraph MCP for broad search):
   - Find all definitions of taint effects constants
   - Find where `NoSchedule` and `NoExecute` are used
   - Understand the tolerance matching algorithm
   - Find endpoint slice controller logic

2. **Implement the new effect**:
   - Add `NoScheduleNoTraffic` as a new taint effect constant
   - Update all scheduler/admission checks to handle the new effect
   - Modify endpoint slice controller to exclude nodes with the new effect
   - Add Go tests covering the new behavior

3. **Verify no regressions**:
   - Existing taint effects still work correctly
   - Scheduling tests pass
   - Endpoint controller tests pass
   - Node lifecycle tests pass

## Success Criteria

✅ New taint effect `NoScheduleNoTraffic` is defined and used throughout codebase  
✅ Pods cannot be scheduled on nodes with the taint (unless they have matching toleration)  
✅ Nodes with the taint are excluded from Service EndpointSlices  
✅ Existing pods on nodes with the taint are NOT evicted  
✅ All Kubernetes tests pass  
✅ Code follows Kubernetes conventions  

## Critical Requirement

**YOU MUST MAKE ACTUAL CODE CHANGES.** Do not plan or analyze. You must:

- Add `NoScheduleNoTraffic` constant definition
- Update scheduler/admission controller logic
- Modify endpoint slice controller logic  
- Update node controller as needed
- Add or modify Go tests
- Commit all changes to git
- Verify tests pass

## Testing

```bash
make test
```

**Time Limit:** 15 minutes  
**Estimated Context:** 15,000 tokens  
**Why MCP Helps:** Finding all taint effect references across scheduler, admission, endpoint, and node controllers requires semantic search. Local grep would require multiple searches and might miss critical locations.
