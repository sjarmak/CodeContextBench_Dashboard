PHASE 3 EVALUATION PLAN
=======================

CURRENT STATUS (as of now):
  2/8 trajectories complete
  - big-code-vsc-001 baseline ✓
  - big-code-vsc-001 mcp ✓
  - big-code-servo-001 baseline (IN PROGRESS)

REMAINING:
  6 trajectories to create (~90 min remaining)

EVALUATION WORKFLOW (once all 8 trajectories complete):
====================================================

Step 1: Extract Metrics
  python scripts/extract_big_code_metrics.py jobs/bigcode-comparison-20251220-1014
  
  Output:
  - Token counts (baseline vs MCP)
  - Step counts
  - Total runtime
  - Aggregate statistics

Step 2: LLM Quality Judge
  python scripts/llm_judge_big_code.py jobs/bigcode-comparison-20251220-1014
  
  Output:
  - Quality scores (0-1.0) for each task pair:
    * Tests Pass (50% weight)
    * Code Changes Made (30% weight)
    * Architecture Understanding (20% weight)
  - MCP vs Baseline comparison
  - Which areas MCP excels
  - Overall quality assessment

Step 3: Analysis & Comparison
  Compare results to Trevor's research findings:
  - Does MCP show architectural understanding advantage?
  - Does broader search (more tokens) translate to better solutions?
  - Which task types benefit most from MCP?

TIMING:
  ~12:00-12:15 UTC: All 8 trajectories complete
  ~12:15-12:20 UTC: Metrics extraction
  ~12:20-12:30 UTC: LLM judge evaluation (calls Claude)
  ~12:30 UTC: Full analysis ready

WHAT WE'LL MEASURE:
  1. Token efficiency (Baseline vs MCP)
  2. Solution quality (LLM judge scores)
  3. Architectural understanding (Judge evaluation)
  4. MCP value for big code tasks (Token spend vs Quality gain)

EVALUATION CRITERIA (from reward.json):
  - Tests Pass: Did code changes make tests pass?
  - Code Changes: Did agent actually modify code (not just analyze)?
  - Architecture: Does solution show understanding of full system design?

EXPECTED FINDINGS (from Trevor's research):
  - MCP should use MORE tokens (broader searches)
  - MCP should show BETTER architecture understanding
  - MCP should find ALL integration points (not just partial)
  - Token-for-token: MCP more valuable on large codebases
