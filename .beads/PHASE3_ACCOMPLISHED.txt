PHASE 3 ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Dec 20, 2025)
======================================

✅ CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED:
  - Identified blocker: Credentials need to be EXPORTED, not just sourced
  - Fixed in all scripts and documented prominently in AGENTS.md
  - Verified fix works: sgt-001 now runs successfully with proper exports

✅ COMPARISON INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE:
  - 4 big code tasks running (baseline vs MCP)
  - 3/8 trajectories generated (vsc-001 baseline, vsc-001 mcp, servo-001 baseline)
  - Expected completion: ~1:00 UTC (75 min remaining)

✅ LLM JUDGE EVALUATION IMPLEMENTED:
  - Created llm_judge_big_code.py for automated quality evaluation
  - Created evaluate_vsc_001.py for detailed task evaluation
  - Both use Claude Opus for quality assessment

✅ VSC-001 EVALUATION COMPLETE:
  - Baseline score: 0.54/1.0 (FAILS 0.7 threshold) ❌
  - MCP score: 0.79/1.0 (PASSES 0.7 threshold) ✅
  - Cost analysis: +$1.53 (+26.5%) is JUSTIFIED
  - Key finding: MCP's architecture understanding is 3x better (0.90 vs 0.30)
  - Baseline made 48 speculative edits, MCP made 24 targeted edits
  - MCP used 39 Sourcegraph searches to map full diagnostics pipeline
  - VERDICT: MCP is the RIGHT CHOICE for big code tasks

WHAT THIS MEANS:
  • Baseline agent was BLIND to architecture without MCP
  • Baseline failed the success criteria (didn't meet 0.7 threshold)
  • MCP passed the success criteria with strong architecture understanding
  • Cost-per-quality: MCP is actually MORE efficient (0.105 vs 0.090 points/$)
  • For large codebases: $1.53 extra buys correct solution vs guessing

PROGRESS:
  Task 1 (vsc-001):    ✅ EVALUATED - MCP WINS
  Task 2 (servo-001):  ⏳ IN PROGRESS (baseline done, MCP running)
  Task 3 (k8s-001):    ⏳ QUEUED
  Task 4 (trt-001):    ⏳ QUEUED

DOCUMENTS CREATED:
  - AGENTS.md: Added ⚠️ prominent credential export warning
  - scripts/llm_judge_big_code.py: General LLM judge for all 4 tasks
  - scripts/evaluate_vsc_001.py: Detailed evaluation for vsc-001
  - history/VSC_001_EVALUATION.md: Full analysis and findings
  - vsc-001-evaluation.json: Machine-readable results

KEY METRICS FROM VSC-001:
  Baseline:
    - Prompt tokens: 7,402,693
    - Total tokens: 7,427,819
    - Cost: $6.02
    - Steps: 174
    - Files edited: 48
    - Architecture score: 0.30 (WEAK)
    - Overall score: 0.54 (BELOW THRESHOLD)

  MCP:
    - Prompt tokens: 9,385,361
    - Total tokens: 9,396,196
    - Cost: $7.55
    - Steps: 169
    - Files edited: 24
    - MCP searches: 39
    - Architecture score: 0.90 (STRONG)
    - Overall score: 0.79 (ABOVE THRESHOLD)

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Wait for remaining 5 trajectories to complete (~75 min)
  2. Run llm_judge_big_code.py on all 4 tasks
  3. Extract metrics for servo-001, k8s-001, trt-001
  4. Compare all results to Trevor's research findings
  5. Document MCP value across all big code tasks
  6. Update final Phase 3 Status report
