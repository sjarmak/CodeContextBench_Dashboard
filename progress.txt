## Codebase Patterns
- Harbor adapter pattern: loader → adapter → CLI (see benchmarks/locobench_agent/, benchmarks/swebench_pro/)
- Adapter data models use frozen @dataclass for immutability
- Task output structure: task.toml, instruction.md, environment/Dockerfile, tests/test.sh, solution/ (optional)
- Verifier outputs: /logs/verifier/reward.json and /logs/verifier/reward.txt
- Templates use {key} replacement pattern (simple string substitution)
- Ingestion pipeline: src/ingest/ (harbor_parser.py, swebench_parser.py, database.py, orchestrator.py)
- Config loader: src/config/loader.py with YAML/JSON support and config inheritance
- Dashboard: Streamlit with Plotly charts, views in dashboard/views/, utils in dashboard/utils/
- Python 3.12 with type annotations, ruff for linting, py_compile for basic typecheck
- Tests go in tests/ or benchmark-specific tests/ directories
- Use immutable patterns: {**dict, key: value} for dict updates, [*list, item] for list appends

## 2026-01-28 - US-012
- What was implemented: Verified existing documentation meets all acceptance criteria
- Files changed: prd.json (updated passes: true)
- Documentation already complete:
  - README.md: Overview, Quick Start, CLI Reference, Verification, Language Support
  - DESIGN.md: Architecture diagram, key design decisions, data flow, extension points
  - docs/TASK_SELECTION_CRITERIA.md: Scoring formula, weights, category bonuses
  - SMOKE_TEST_RESULTS.md: Test results, infrastructure issues, recommendations
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Documentation was already created in previous iterations (US-011 notes mention SMOKE_TEST_RESULTS.md)
  - Always verify existing files before assuming they need creation
  - The LoCoBench adapter is a complete reference implementation for future Harbor adapters
